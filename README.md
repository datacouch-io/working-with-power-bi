# Working with Power BI Instructor Notes

## Introduction

This course is designed to be delivered interactively over a 4 day period of time.

As of writing this I still generally consider the course to be in draft format, it has been battled tested, but there are quite a few areas where it could be improved.

It will be up to the instructor to fill in weakness with demonstration!

Please feel free to write the original author [matt@rcc.team](mailto:matt@rcc.team), for some general advice on delivery or to provide suggestions for course changes.  You may also reach out to see if there are updates available as I may improve this with any future delivery that I perform.

Develop Intelligence, a Pluralsight company, has purchased perpetual rights to this material and can author and distribute it to any students taking one of their courses.  **Instructors are NOT licensed to use this training material for delivery that is not through one of these companies**.  Licenses can be obtained both on a per-student basis and as a perpetual license for unlimited student distribution and delivery.  I ask that The Reliable Collaboration Company continue to be referenced as a copywrite holder, however feel free to add more prominent Pluralsight branding!

## Course Preparation

### Required Software

Power BI Desktop (free)

Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (free)

Microsoft Excel (commercial license required) – could probably get by with google sheets but labs are not set up for this.

### Recommended Software

XMind 8 ( free for windows) for brainstorming exercises: [\[XMind 8 Pro - XMind - Mind Mapping Software\]](https://www.xmind.app/xmind8-pro/)

DBeaver Community Edition – (free) better data exploratory options than SSMS

## Databases

You will need to have samples databases hosted and accessible to students.  Consider using: [enriquecatala/mssql-server-samplesdb: SQL Server docker image with all sample databases (github.com)](https://github.com/enriquecatala/mssql-server-samplesdb)

  

## Module Notes and Timing

Each module is broken down into sections, there are sometimes cues for instructors to provide a demonstration, but of course some level of demonstration should be happening throughout.

There are some prompts for some good discussions, but in general at the end of each section would be a great time to pause any lector or demonstration and be sure that students are involved with questions and further discussion about the content just covered.

Each module is followed by a series of exercises.

**I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT AN INSTRUCTOR PERFORM THESE EXERCISES ON THEIR OWN BEFORE THE CLASS.  In their current state for them to work, you’ll want to add to them during your demonstrations.  Specifically add reports and visuals and possibly some calculations that are not already added by later modules.  These are not quite mature enough to stand entirely on their own yet, but they’re getting close!**

Module timing is not perfect yet as at the time of writing this it has only been delivered once and has changed quite a bit based on the experience of delivering it.  For the most part, assume 2 modules per day.

There is a weakness of content related to building out visualizations and describing visualizations.  An instructor will need to supplement this content with examples of practical visualizations throughout.  In the future a new module could probably be added.

There is a weakness of content related to the Power BI Service.  It is recommended that an hour or so be spent demonstrating how to publish to Power BI Service and building dashboards and some talk about licensing and how an organization might move beyond Power BI Desktop
